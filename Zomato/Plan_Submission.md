Overview

Hypothesis: If a restaurant generates a large bill total per customer then the attendee has a higher income compared to attendees at other restaurants.

Project Overview

Analyze the data given to determine if the hypothesis is true. In order to do so we will use data from Orders, Restaurant, and Users in order to test the hypothesis.
Analysis can also be performed on if a restaurant has a high revenue does this also mean it is most popular?

Goals
Use the data given to be able to see if the data supports the generated hypothesis. 

Visualizations
- Map: Comparing where the concentration of restaurants is and the total sales in each area
- A bar graph: Showing how much the total was at each restaurant per customer
- A pie chart: Comparing the restaurants and the total sales (of restaurants that make more than $1,000,000)
- A bar graph: Relating restaurant to rankings
- Card: Average rating
- Card: Average sales
- Card: Median sales
- Assigning a certain category to a restaurant (not only on the values given in the dataset, but on actual average check in restaurant) --> Based on average check in a restaurant you can split restaurants into price group 
- Distribution of customers by different income across different "price categories" of restaurants.
- Within each group of customers analyze their actual average check. For example, customer may belong to a group with high income, but the average check will be low.
