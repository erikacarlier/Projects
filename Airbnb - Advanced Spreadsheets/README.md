## Project Description:

A consulting firm wants to purchase new short term rental properties in the Manhattan borough of New York City. The project dealt with using current data from Airbnb listings to determine which borough properties would be most profitable purchasing in.

## The following questions were used as a guide:
- Which type of properties should be targeted?
- Which neighborhoods are most attractive for vacation rentals?
- Which size properties (i.e., how many bedrooms) are most popular for vacation rentals?
- Whatâ€™s the average occupancy for each listing?
- Which days of the week have the highest occupancy rates?
- What is the estimated revenue for an investment property?
