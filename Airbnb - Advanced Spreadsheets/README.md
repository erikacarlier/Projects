## Project Description:

I’ve been hired by a consulting company and my task is to help a client analyze the vacation rental market in the Manhattan borough of New York City. The client is interested in investing in several properties but would like some guidance on what types of properties they should be targeting. Your role in the project is to analyze data collected on current Airbnb listings to identify useful insights in which Manhattan borough they should purchase a property in.

## The following questions were used as a guide:
- Which type of properties should be targeted?
- Which neighborhoods are most attractive for vacation rentals?
- Which size properties (i.e., how many bedrooms) are most popular for vacation rentals?
- What’s the average occupancy for each listing?
- Which days of the week have the highest occupancy rates?
- What is the estimated revenue for an investment property?
